# Setup Obniz Board as a counter & store data in Kintone Web Database all in 10 minutes!

## Introduction

### What is [Obniz Board](https://Obniz.com/products/Obnizboard/)?

Obniz Board is an IoT Microprocessor that is easily programable with JavaScript!  
The code can be stored on the cloud & you have full device control with just one JavaScript library, making it an ideal IoT device for a hackathon.

### What is [Kintone](https://www.kintone.com/)?
Kintone is acloud platform that creates Web Databases ridiculously quickly!
Databases are created with intuitive drag-and-drop GUI and since your data lives in the cloud, no need to worry about servers to maintain. Control everything on your browser or use REST API.

## Get an Obniz Board
Obniz Board is on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD6FK8G) for $49 (At the time of publishing).  
This tutorial assumes you are using the [original Obniz Board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DD6FK8G), but you can use their [newer Obniz Board 1Y](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082MDPRWZ) as well.

## Connect Obniz Board to WiFi

Now that you are a proud owner of Obniz Board, time to plug it in & connect it to WiFi.

Overview of the parts
![Graphic overview of the Obniz Board. Micro USB: power can be turned on/off by connecting/disconnecting to the battery; Dial switch: cursor is moved when turning the dial witch. Click the dial switch to select it; 12x IOs with motor driver (up to 1A) & Analog Input](https://obniz.com/doc/reference/board-1y/quick-start/images/board_description.png?)

We will be using the **Dial Switch** as the input mechanism.

### Step 1: Plug-in the Obniz Board to power via Micro USB cable
Turn on the Obniz Board by plugging in a Micro USB that is connected to a charger, battery, or PC.

### Step 2: Connect to the Obniz Board's network from your PC
Obniz Board can act as a WiFi access point for configuring it from a browser.

The network name will be `obniz-XXXXXXXXXX`

### Step 3: Open [http://192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1)

### Step 4: Select the target WiFi network's SSID from the pull-down menu

### Step 5: Enter the password in alphanumeric characters.

### Step 6: Press "**Connect**" button to complete the process.

### Success + obnizID
Once you have your Obniz Board successfully connected to the internet, a QR Code and the 8-digit **obnizID** will be displayed.

For details on the process, refer to [Obniz Document on Setting from Browser](https://obniz.com/doc/reference/obnizos-for-esp32/settings/setting-via-browser).

If an error is displayed or Obniz Board is not starting up, refer to [Obniz Troubleshooting Guide](https://obniz.com/quickstart/troubleshooting)


## Configure the Script.js

The code needed for this Obniz Board x Kintone integration is below.
Save the code as `Script.js` and replace the Xs in Line 5 with your obnizID.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you do not update the script with your obnizID, you will get a prompt each time you view the Kintone Database App.

``` javascript
(() => {
  'use strict';

  // Instantiate Obniz with Obniz ID & set callback function
  const obniz = new Obniz('XXXX-XXXX');
  kintone.events.on('app.record.index.show', event => {
    obniz.onconnect = async () => {
      let count = 0;

      // Gets the input from the built-in black switch
      // Switch's 4 states: "none", "push", "left", "right"
      obniz.switch.onchange = function (state) {
        obniz.display.clear();
        if (state === 'right') {
          count++;
        } else if (state === 'left') {
          count--;
        } else if (state === 'push') {
          // Kintone REST API Request
          // kintone.api(pathOrUrl, method, params, opt_callback, opt_errback)

          const pathOrUrl = kintone.api.url('/k/v1/record', true);

          const method = 'POST';

          const body = {
            'app': kintone.app.getId(),
            'record': {
              'Number': {
                'value': count
              }
            }
          };

          kintone.api(pathOrUrl, method, body,
            function (resp) {
              // Successful API Call
              console.log(resp);
            },
            function (error) {
              // Error
              console.log(error);
            });
          obniz.display.print('Saved to Kintone');
        }

        // Display the current count on Obniz
        obniz.display.print(count);
      };
    };
  });
})();
```

## Create the Database
Databases in Kintone are called "Apps".

This video will go over how to make a Kintone Database for this project.
The steps it takes are also written below.

{% youtube BN2MUETsyXI %}

1. Log in to your Kintone Subdomain
    * The URL to your Kintone is [`YOUR_SUBDOMAIN`.kintone.com]()
    * Ex/ `demo` subdomain is accessed at [demo.kintone.com](http://demo.kintone.com/)}
2. Find the "**Apps**" section on the left side of the Portal page
    * Click on the [ **+** ] button on the left side
    * ![](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lu0uvfbhxw22wh97ay7f.png)
3. Select the "**Create App from Scratch**" button from the Kintone Marketplace page
    * ![](https://get.kintone.help/k/img-en/tutorial_01.png)
4. Name the Database by clicking on & replacing `New App` with `Obniz Counter`
    * ![Step 4](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0zmixcjchl1cu1kf0pdv.gif)
5. Drag-&-Drop a **Number** field, click on the left gear ‚öôÔ∏è icon & name it `Count`
6. Drag-&-Drop the **Created datetime** field
7. Click the green **Save Form** button
    * ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/shumjv4mcrt1hznp11cv.gif)
8. Click the **App Settings** tab, then click on the **JavaScript and CSS Customization** section
9.  Under the **Upload JavaScript for PC** section, click on the **Add Link** button & past-in `https://unpkg.com/obniz@2.0.3/obniz.js`
    * This is the CDN URL to the Obniz's JavaScript library
10. Still under the **Upload JavaScript for PC** section, click on the **Add File** and upload the `Script.js` file from the [Configure the Script.js](#configure-the-scriptjs) section
11. Click the blue **Save** button at the top
12. Finally, click on the blue **Activate App** button
    * ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/1gd7emuvq5f879bqbfic.gif)

Your Kintone Database is now ready!  
You can access it from the **Portal** Page under the **Apps** section.

## Verify

Time to test your new counter!

1. Open your browser to Kintone Database App's Record List View.  
    * ‚ö†Ô∏è Enter your obnizID a prompt requesting it appears. To prevent this prompt from appearing in the future, configure the `Script.js` with your obnizID.
2. Verify if Obniz Board is connected by seeing it display a `PIN ASSIGN` screen like below.
    * ![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/o60omk79zul4em69wyc3.png)
3. Now move the **Dial Switch** (Black Wheel Nob, Top Left) to the **Right** and click **Click** it
4. A new record in the `Obniz Counter` Database App should appear with `1` as the count.

| Record List Page | Record Details Page |
