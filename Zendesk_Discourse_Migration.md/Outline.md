# Outline of Zendesk to Discourse Migration Article


## Warnings

Edit the Zendesk URLs made in the community posts!
* Zendesk only keeps the path section of the URL (not the subdomain & domain) thus when you import the content to Discourse it leads to broken URLs
* Example:
  * Zendesk: `Get Records: https://developer.kintone.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019245194`
  * Discourse Migration: `Get Records: [https://developer.kintone.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019245194](/hc/en-us/articles/360019245194)`
