Homework
* <https://config.figma.com/agenda/session?session_id=dd264cc5a405&lang=en>


## General Notes

* Design Devs seem really common - devs that live within the design team
* Read from top to bottom -> settings, contents, & settings
* Settings & tools -> should be predictable
* Career path = Manager & Staff
  * Offer two different positions with the same rank & benefits
  * Manager for those who want to lead
  * Staff for those who want to focus on the task & skillset


## Figma Plugin

* Join the Figma x Dev Forum
* Figma x Azure translation plug-in -> Worth building
  * Stress test design with Dutch & German (Short to long)


## Product Launch

* When doing presentations - have a person with live-tech support
* Ready for dev - workflow setup to streamline designers to devs
* Focus View - See 1 frame at a time
* Code connect - Establish a link between a design system within Figma
  * SDK - Upload code to Figma
  * Encourages devs use the design system


### Figma x AI

* Translations? Wording edits?
* Search from image to find the components or similar design
  * Find components via simple sketch
* Help generate the first draft


## Wording Notes

* Connect = Invite external members
* Ex/ Connect Workspace -> Figma workspace with external users
* Admin control -> Settings for admins to configure the product
* Visual search for community & teams
* Let AI do the grunt work


## Writing Workflow

* See if “rename layer name” feature can help streamline


## AI

* Find what you need; stay in the flow; and get started
* Just use OpenAI
* AI features require “make changes” or “edit prompt” feature for iterative workflow


## UX Writer @Figma

* AI is a tool; use it!
* TODO: Make slides/article about current workflow with GitHub copilot
* Example: FigJam Colors -
  * Use it for brainstorm
* Writing Figma Slides Copies - Tooltips
  *      Use AI to verify if you forgot a tooltip
  *      Try and iterate
  * TODO: Try Anthropic AI
  * Auditing Figma Notifications -
TODO: Writing test - Tooltip, accessibility, add a typo; use AI to generate an example and see how they would improve it.
* …………………………………………
* TODO: UX writing x AI workflow content is lacking; I should create some
* …..
* Writing is technology


## Complexity Creep


## Global Audience

* Design manager - Organize the meetings, reporting, logistics
* UX Writer -
* Timezone issue - Comment on Figma asynchronous
* Workflow - Complex (see photo) but have it as check-points
  * Skip as needed but the check-points are there to ensure we thought of it
* Naming templates & components after city or states
  * Do not make it technical
  * Make it remember

* International English - Simple, standard, not specific to UK or US


## Migration Content

* Once an org is going to migrate to a new digital tool/platform; individuals do not care about “new feature” but rather addressing the pain points
  * Figma Slides was more popular than AI new feature
* Ask individuals making the move, * what are you concerned about? What sucks right now?
* Example: Office move; most popular question was, where to get coffee? Which elevator to take?; most popular: coffee machine


## Figma Plug-in

* Plugin’s interface is just HTML; Vue framework(?)
* Backend -> Figma
* `themeColors` set as true to access Figma’s color CSS
* end the postMessage with `”*”`
