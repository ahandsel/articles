# Figma ConFig 2024 Notes


## Homework

* [Session Agenda](https://config.figma.com/agenda/session?session_id=dd264cc5a405&lang=en)


## General Notes

* Design devs seem really common - developers that live within the design team.
* Read from top to bottom -> settings, contents, & settings.
* Settings & tools should be predictable.
* Career path = Manager & Staff
  * Offer two different positions with the same rank & benefits.
  * Manager for those who want to lead.
  * Staff for those who want to focus on tasks & skillsets.


## Figma Plugin

* Join the Figma x Dev Forum.
* Figma x Azure translation plug-in -> Worth building.
  * Stress test design with Dutch & German (Short to long).


## Product Launch

* When doing presentations, have a person with live-tech support.
* Ready for dev - workflow setup to streamline designers to developers.
* Focus View - See one frame at a time.
* Code connect - Establish a link between a design system within Figma.
  * SDK - Upload code to Figma.
  * Encourages developers to use the design system.


## Figma x AI

* Translations? Wording edits?
* Search from an image to find components or similar design.
  * Find components via simple sketch.
* Help generate the first draft.


## Wording Notes

* Connect = Invite external members.
* Ex/ Connect Workspace -> Figma workspace with external users.
* Admin control -> Settings for admins to configure the product.
* Visual search for community & teams.
* Let AI do the grunt work.


## Writing Workflow

* See if the "rename layer name" feature can help streamline.


## AI

* Find what you need, stay in the flow, and get started.
* Just use OpenAI.
* AI features require a "make changes" or "edit prompt" feature for an iterative workflow.


## UX Writer @Figma

* AI is a tool; use it!
* TODO: Make slides/articles about the current workflow with GitHub Copilot.
* Example: FigJam Colors -
  * Use it for brainstorming.
* Writing Figma Slides Copies - Tooltips
  * Use AI to verify if you forgot a tooltip.
  * Try and iterate.
  * TODO: Try Anthropic AI.
  * Auditing Figma Notifications -
    * TODO: Writing test - Tooltip, accessibility, add a typo; use AI to generate an example and see how they would improve it.
* TODO: UX writing x AI workflow content is lacking; I should create some.
* Writing is technology.


## Complexity Creep


## Global Audience

* Design manager - Organize the meetings, reporting, logistics.
* UX Writer -
* Timezone issue - Comment on Figma asynchronously.
* Workflow - Complex (see photo) but have it as checkpoints.
  * Skip as needed, but the checkpoints are there to ensure we thought of it.
* Naming templates & components after cities or states.
  * Do not make it technical.
  * Make it memorable.
* International English - Simple, standard, not specific to UK or US.


## Migration Content

* Once an organization is going to migrate to a new digital tool/platform, individuals do not care about "new features" but rather addressing the pain points.
  * Figma Slides was more popular than AI new features.
* Ask individuals making the move, * what are you concerned about? What sucks right now?
* Example: Office move; most popular question was, where to get coffee? Which elevator to take? Most popular: coffee machine.


## Figma Plug-in

* Plugin's interface is just HTML; Vue framework(?).
* Backend -> Figma.
* `themeColors` set as true to access Figma's color CSS.
* End the postMessage with `"*"`.
* [Dotenv for Figma](https://figma.dotenv.dev/)
  * An easy way to download starters to make your Figma plugin without messing with config files.
