## Preparations

Before beginning, make sure to:
1. **Open Visual Studio Code** - Install VS Code from [Visual Studio Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if it is not already installed.
2. **Have a Workspace or File Open** - You need an open file or project to work with bulk edit features.


## Steps to Bulk Edit Files in VS Code


### Using Change All Occurrences

The **Change All Occurrences** feature in VS Code allows you to select all instances of a word or selection and edit them simultaneously.

1. **Select the Word or Text**  
   Use your mouse to select the word or block of text you want to edit across your file.

2. **Invoke Change All Occurrences**  
   Press `Command + Shift + L` to highlight all occurrences of the selected text within your file.

3. **Edit the Text**  
   With all instances selected, type to edit. Changes you make will apply to each selected instance.

> Summary of Step 1: The **Change All Occurrences** feature allows for quick modifications across your file by selecting identical words or phrases and editing them simultaneously.


### Using Multi-Cursor Editing

**Multi-Cursor Editing** allows you to place multiple cursors in different parts of your code, enabling simultaneous editing in those locations.

1. **Place Multiple Cursors**  
   To place a cursor on multiple lines, hold `Option` and click on each line where you want a cursor. You can also hold `Command + Option + Down Arrow` or `Command + Option + Up Arrow` to add a cursor on the line below or above, respectively.

2. **Edit the Lines Simultaneously**  
   Once your cursors are in place, type to make changes. Each cursor will apply your edits to its position.

> Summary of Step 2: **Multi-Cursor Editing** is useful for editing multiple lines at once, saving time when working on repetitive structures.


### Customizing Keybindings for Bulk Editing

VS Code allows you to customize keybindings for the **Change All Occurrences** and **Multi-Cursor Editing** features.

1. **Open Keyboard Shortcuts**  
   Go to `Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts` or use the shortcut `Command + K, Command + S`.

2. **Search for Change All Occurrences**  
   In the search bar, type "Change All Occurrences" to locate this feature. Right-click and select **Change Keybinding** to assign a new shortcut.

3. **Search for Multi-Cursor Keybindings**  
   Search for "Add Cursor Above" or "Add Cursor Below" to adjust multi-cursor shortcuts. Right-click and select **Change Keybinding** to modify these as well.

4. **Save and Test the New Keybindings**  
   After adjusting your shortcuts, test them in a file to ensure they work as expected.

> Summary of Step 3: Customizing your keybindings allows you to tailor VS Codeâ€™s bulk editing features to fit your workflow.


## Restrictions

The **Change All Occurrences** and **Multi-Cursor Editing** features are limited to individual files. They do not apply across multiple open files or the entire project. For project-wide modifications, consider using **Find and Replace** across files (`Command + Shift + F`).
