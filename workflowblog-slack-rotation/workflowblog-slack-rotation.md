# [Workflow Optimization Blog] How to manage meeting host rotation on Slack?


## TL;DR


## Background

My team has a daily standup meeting on Slack huddle and we want an easy way to select a meeting host.

What we want (in order of importance):
1. Select a meeting host (either randomly or in rotation)
1. Schedule a Slack post to announce the meeting host and remind the team about the meeting


## Candidates


### Eeny

* [Eeny | Slack App Directory](https://config24.slack.com/apps/ASGF3VDU0-eeny?tab=more_info)
* Eeny will randomly pick users for you from a channel or a custom list.
* Pros:
  * Easy to get started
  * Free
  * Works with [Slack reminders](https://slack.com/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder) for automatic scheduling
* Cons:
  * No rotation feature
  * Some users are selected more often than others (randomness is different from fairness)
